# MV 1st period 

Make a grid of to two horizontal lines and two vertical lines that cross.

Bring in a random number generator and a human. 

Have human update the grid by placing an X somewhere on the 9 empty spaces.

After the human has placed have the bot do the same thing but it can't place a O in any spot where the X is.
