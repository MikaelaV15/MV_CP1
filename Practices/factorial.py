#MV 1st Factorial calculator 

#make a list (4-50)
numbers = [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50]

## Return the list for the user to see
print(numbers) 

#User input ()
int(input("what number would you like to use from the list?"))

#if user input != list:
#print wrong input
if numbers not in list:
    print("That number can not be used try again")
    int(input("Pick a number from the list"))
#for number in list:



#print user input 


#print(original: New_num)


#number > list 


#find all nums less than user input then multiply them





#make a statement that prints f"string(original:"user input" New Num:"Value thats factorized")
